# COEN490 Project
<div>
  <p>COEN490 Project for Fall-Winter semesters of 2022-2023</p>
  
  <h2> Project Description </h2> 
<p> Our team is set on creating a wearable device (bracelet) that can monitor the health status
of a patient in a hospital or care home and relay the information to an application on the
assigned nurse’s phone. The nurse can receive alerts about the patient’s status, and even
verify in real time the patient health status. The nurse would also be able to verify patient
information, allergies, and past issues (medical record). </p>
